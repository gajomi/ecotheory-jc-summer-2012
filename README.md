#The idea
This is a repo for the Weitz lab journal club during the summer of 2012. We are reading classical papers. When we are done reading the papers we go and do something about it.

#The papers
* [http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/j100540a008](Exact stochastic simulation of coupled chemical reactions. DT Gillespie - J. Phys. Chem., 1977, 81 (25), pp 2340â€“2361 - ACS Publications)

**The beginning of this [http://videolectures.net/mlss05us_dasgupta_ig/](video) contains a nice overview of entropy with connections to exponential family models.

** I recommend doing a quick read of the original article and a careful read of the first few pages of the following [http://crossgroup.caltech.edu/BNU/Notes7_2.pdf](notes).
** I also recommend the relavant sections of Murray.

#The stuff we did about it
##Turing
*simple MATLAB code for simulating Turing pattern in 1 dimension with periodic boundary conditions and an arbitrary number of reactants
