#The idea
This is a repo for the Weitz lab journal club during the summer of 2012. We are reading classical papers. When we are done reading the papers we go and do something about it.

#The papers
- [Exact stochastic simulation of coupled chemical reactions. DT Gillespie - J. Phys. Chem., 1977, 81 25, pp 2340â€“2361 - ACS Publications](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/j100540a008)
- [Shannon, C.E. 1948. A Mathematical Theory of Communication. Bell System Technical Journal 27:379-423 623-656.](http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/ms/what/shannonday/shannon1948.pdf)
    - The beginning of this [video](http://videolectures.net/mlss05us_dasgupta_ig/) contains a nice overview of entropy with connections to exponential family models.
- [Turing, A.M. 1952. The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis. Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London. Series B, Biological Sciences 237 (641):37-72.](http://www.dna.caltech.edu/courses/cs191/paperscs191/turing.pdf)
    - I recommend doing a quick read of the original article and a careful read of the first few pages of the following [notes](http://crossgroup.caltech.edu/BNU/Notes7_2.pdf).
    - I also recommend the relavant sections of Murray. 
- [Stephen WOLFRAM (1984): UNIVERSALITY  AND COMPLEXITY IN CELLULAR AUTOMATA](http://www.stephenwolfram.com/pdf/Universality-Complexity-Cellular-Automata-Stephen-Wolfram-Article.pdf)

#The stuff we did about it
##Turing
- simple MATLAB code for simulating Turing pattern in 1 dimension with periodic boundary conditions and an arbitrary number of reactants
